# dijkstra_maze
This is a program to visualize Dijkstra's algorithm in a self-generated maze.

## Description

Provide a more in-depth paragraph about your project here. Explain what your project does, its features, and maybe a little background.

## Project Structure

This project is divided into four main parts, each contained in separate Python files:

### 1. Vertices and Grid Build Definition

- **File Name**: `graph.py`, `vertex.py`
- **Description**: 
  - Contains the definitions and vertices for the construction of the grid.
  - This file lays the foundational structure upon which the maze will be generated.

### 2. Maze Generation

- **File Name**: `WAIT TO BE REPLACED` 
- **Description**: 
  - Responsible for the algorithm that generates the maze on the grid.
  - It uses the structure defined in `VERTICES` to create a maze.

### 3. Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation

- **File Name**: `dijkstra.py` 
- **Description**: 
  - Implements Dijkstra's algorithm.
  - This file is key for pathfinding within the maze, determining the shortest path from start to finish.

### 4. Main Program File

- **File Name**: `main.py` 
- **Description**: 
  - The driver script that runs the entire program.
  - It connects each part of the program, integrating the grid build, maze generation, and Dijkstra's algorithm to create and solve the maze.
